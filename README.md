# Hangman offers a captivating solo word-guessing experience. Players select difficulty levels and themes, adding personalization. The game starts with a hidden word represented by dashes. Players guess letters to unveil the word, with correct guesses revealing positions. Each incorrect guess adds to a gallows or hangman's scaffold. Players set a limit for incorrect guesses based on difficulty. Success hinges on decoding the word within the limit. Hangman tests vocabulary and deductive skills, offering tailored challenges and themes for immersive gameplay.
